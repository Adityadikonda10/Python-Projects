## The deck is unlimited in size.
## There are no jokers.
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game:
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here:
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements:
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created:
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt


#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]


def deal_cards(card, u_cards):
    """Deals cards"""
    u_cards.append(random.choice(card))
    return u_cards

def deal(card):
    """Deals the begining card"""
    u_cards = []
    i = 0
    while i < 2 :
        u_cards.append(random.choice(card))
        i+=1
    return u_cards

#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
user_cards = []
computer_cards = []

# random cards for user
user_cards = deal(cards)
print(user_cards)

# random cards for user
computer_cards = deal(cards)
print(computer_cards)

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input
#and returns the score.
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.
def calculate_score(card):
    score = sum(card)
    if score > 21:
        for n in card:
            if n == 11:
                card.remove(11)
                card.append(1)
                score = sum(card)
                return score
        return score

    else:
        return score

user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)
print(user_score)
computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)
print(computer_score)
#Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game. done

#Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove(). done

#Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends. done

#Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended. done

#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends. done


#Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17. done

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
